# Prompt injections

The `prompt_injections.csv` file is a concatenation of prompts from the following libraries:

- https://github.com/leondz/garak
- https://github.com/agencyenterprise/PromptInject

with their respective licenses in the `licenses` directory.

## Setup and validation

The pip `requirement.txt` is only needed to run `validate.py`, a minimal validation script to ensure that the prompt injection data is generated in the correct format.
